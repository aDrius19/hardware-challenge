# Hardware Challenge
Mini project made by [stratec](https://www.stratec.com/) company (Cluj-Napoca office, Romania) as part of a challenge in order to apply for an intership program in 2023 (Hardware based)

It was possible to complete it only by coding, but I had also had the hardware components (```Arduino board```, ```3D printed rack and pinion```, ```L298N driver module```, ```TT gearmotor```).
All of the details of the challenge are visibile in the ```2023_Internship_Challenge_Hardware.pdf``` document and the documentation, made by me after completing the challenge, is available in the ```Hardware_Challenge_Documentation.pdf```. 

The source code is available in the ```stratec_Challenge``` directory and is done in Arduino programming language (```.ino``` file). This is an updated verion, 
adjusted after some feedback from the technical manager that interviewed me. The full, original version is in the documentation file.
